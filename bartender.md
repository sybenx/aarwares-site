Played the game? [Take a Survey](https://forms.gle/mPD71fr6YsUsrQp18)

A game where players battle for influence and power in a medieval town full of thirsty people. Players can use cards to attack or defend their bartenders, such as persuading customers, raiding establishments, or digging deadly traps. The player who builds a monopoly of bartenders and captures most important customers wins.
