# Bartender Rules

**_notice! if you have multiple Heart Aces, make sure you only have one before playing_**

Shuffle deck, deal 7 cards to each player, including coins. Then separate coins from deck, making two draw and discard piles: coin pile and main draw pile, and a space for shovels. Place these on opposite ends of the playing area.

In front of each player is their own bar where their cards are in play. Always immediately play bartender (KQJ) and customer (heart) cards.

A customer and bartender are a "happy customer". One customer per bartender. For each happy customer a coin is drawn at the beginning of the game and at the beginning of a player's turn up to a hand of 7. During a player's turn, they also draw from the main draw pile up to a hand of 7. The player to go first is the one with the fewest happy customers.

A player starts their turn by drawing coins for each happy customer they have up to a hand of 7, then drawing from the main draw pile up to a hand of 7 if needed. They play raiders and coins as they wish, discard unwanted cards, and can play a single shovel per turn which ends their turn.

To win the game, a player must have 4 of a kind of bartenders along with at least 3 customers and the Ace customer card.

Shovels (spades) are used to "dig a hole", which is a separate shared discard pile. Once the value of the shovels in the hole pile adds to 25 or more, the player who played the final shovel chooses a bartender to bury (discard) along with all shovels in the hole. If the attacked player plays a higher value shovel, the attack is prevented and instead chooses a bartender to bury. The main draw pile and shovels from the hole are shuffled and the buried bartender is placed at the bottom.

Raiders (clubs) can be played on a bartender to raid it. If successful, the bartender is taken out of play and placed in the market (center playing field). Bartenders in the market can be obtained by any player on their turn by playing a coin card on the bartender, starting a bid. All players can participate in the bid, highest played coin card wins the bartender. To prevent a raider from raiding a bartender, a higher raider or coin card must be played. All played cards are discarded after use whether they are successful or not.

Coins can also be used to advertise to a customer. If successful the customer card is transferred to the player's bar. An equal or higher value coin can be immediately played on that customer to keep it. A raider of equal or higher value can also be played to destroy the advertisement and keep the customer.

If you have bartenders or customers that aren't part of a happy customer pair, turn them at the end of your turn. If the a pair isn't made after drawing on the next turn, turned customers are discarded and turned bartenders enter the market.
