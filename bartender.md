# Bartender Rules

**_notice! if you have multiple Heart Aces, make sure you only have one before playing_**

Game can be played with a normal deck of playing cards (1 deck for 2 players, 2 decks for 3-4).

### _To Play_

Separate coins from deck, making two shuffled draw and discard piles for coins and one main draw pile on opposite ends of the market square (the center playing area).

In front of each player is their own bar where their own cards are in play.

Deal 7 cards to each player. Players immediately play bartender (KQJ) and customer (heart) cards. Anytime these cards are drawn they are played immediately, pairing bartenders with customers.

The player with the fewest paired bartenders goes first. If tied, player with fewest customers. 

A customer and bartender pair are a "happy customer".

A player starts their turn by drawing coins for each happy customer they have up to a hand of 7, then drawing the rest from the main draw pile if needed. They play raiders against other players bartender's and coins to win over other player's customers and may discard unwanted cards. At the end of their turn, the player can play a single shovel which ends their turn.

To win the game, a player must obtain 4 of a kind of bartenders along with a customer for every bartender, including the Ace customer card.

To defend against an attacking player, a player can play an equal or higher value raider or coin against raiders and coins. If a player is about to lose any card, they can execute that card with a shovel.

Shovels (spades) are used to "dig a hole", which is a separate shared discard pile by the market square. Once the value of the shovels in the hole adds to 25 or more, the player who played the final shovel chooses a bartender to bury (discard) along with all shovels in the hole. If the attacked player plays a higher value shovel, the attack is prevented and instead chooses a bartender to bury. The main draw pile and shovels from the hole are shuffled and the buried bartender is placed at the bottom.

Raiders (clubs) can be played on a bartender to raid it. If successful, the bartender is taken out of play and placed in the market (center playing field). Bartenders in the market can be obtained by any player on their turn by playing a coin card on the bartender, starting a bid. All players can participate in the bid, highest played coin card wins the bartender. To prevent a raider from raiding a bartender, a higher raider or coin card must be played. All played cards are discarded after use whether they are successful or not.

Coins can also be used to advertise to a customer. If successful the customer card is transferred to the player's bar. An equal or higher value coin can be immediately played on that customer to keep it. A raider of equal or higher value can also be played to destroy the advertisement and keep the customer.

If you have bartenders or customers that aren't part of a happy customer pair, turn them at the end of your turn. If the a pair isn't made after drawing on the next turn, turned customers are discarded and turned bartenders enter the market.
