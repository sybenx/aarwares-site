Sour Business

>A kid friendly version of Bartender. Same rules, different cards.

A game where players battle for territory and customers in a neighborhood full of thirsty people. Players can use cards to attack or defend their stands, such as bullying, bringing Karen to complain, or soaking a stand with water balloons. The player with the most stands and customers at the end of the game wins.
